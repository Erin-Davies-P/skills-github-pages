## ***What is Dehumanization?***

Humans, despite being an intelligent species that dominates the planet, have the tendency to classify fellow humans as lesser than themselves when met with people who are different from themselves in regard to race, gender, religion, culture, etc. We refer to this as discrimination. To dehumanize someone is to subject a person to inhuman conditions or give them inhuman treatment. Certain examples of dehumanization are slavery, torture of prisoners, malicious experimentation, and showing hostility to different racial groups or religious groups. Thus, we can consider dehumanization as a sub-group to discrimination.

## ***What is VR?***

When we talk about Virtual Reality (VR), many of us think of science fiction films like ‘Ready Player One’ or ‘The Matrix’. Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated environment with scenes and objects that appear to be real. It makes the person feel immersed in their surroundings. This environment is seen through a device known as a Virtual Reality headset or helmet. VR has many applications in the fields of medicine, culture, education, and architecture.

## ***How does VR help in Dehumanization?***

There are several ways in which VR can help. Firstly, VR can create an environment that gives the person a strong sense of being ‘present’ in a situation involving a dehumanized group. What they see next is akin to watching a documentary. Studies have shown that 360 degree VR can create more empathy within a person when compared to watching from a 2D screen.

The second way of using VR is by enabling virtual contact with members of dehumanized groups. Positive interactions between the two sets of people have shown to be a great way to reduce prejudice between different groups. It could also help overcome the implicit bias that’s present in certain groups of people. In the same vein, negative interactions could further deepen animosities between different groups.

The final way of reducing dehumanization is by immersing oneself as a member of a dehumanized group. There is a saying which goes “walk a mile in his shoes”. It refers to empathizing with the experiences and feelings of another person. In VR, users can embody avatars across different ethnicities, genders, or ages. Thanks to the computer-generated virtual environments and motion tracking, it allows the users to have a sync between their real body and their virtual avatar. This way, a person can literally walk a mile in another person’s shoes and experience the life of another by themselves.

## ***Issues and Concerns***

As with anything this world has to offer, using VR to reduce dehumanization also presents certain issues and concerns.

1. Since VR is relatively new, we don’t have enough data to suggest that using VR is a better way to reduce dehumanization when compared to more affordable options.
2. It’s not clear in what ways a person’s attitudes might change towards a dehumanized group because everyone thinks and acts differently when presented with a situation.
3. There is a risk of ‘gamifying’ the suffering of people. Western video game violence is geared toward certain groups of people. There also exists the matter of over-sexualized portrayal of women. These could cause further increases in dehumanization, objectification of women, and online abuse.

## ***Conclusion***

VR has the potential to reduce dehumanization in many ways. The notable way is being present in a situation where the person could interact with a dehumanized group of people by taking the perspective or the body of a group member. But as of now, there are lots of unanswered questions and undiscussed ethical issues in regards to using VR in such a manner. As such, studies are still being conducted to answer them.
